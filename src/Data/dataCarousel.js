    data :`Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living.
    More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you can't simply "snap out" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both.`

    data:`Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by unwanted, intrusive thoughts, feelings, or images (obsessions) that lead to repetitive and ritualistic behaviors (compulsions) in an effort to reduce anxiety or prevent harm. These compulsive behaviors can interfere with daily activities and relationships, and may include repetitive hand washing, counting, checking, or arranging objects. OCD affects people of all ages, genders, and backgrounds and can cause significant distress and impairment in functioning. Treatment for OCD typically involves a combination of medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy, such as exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, which helps individuals gradually face and overcome their obsessive fears and compulsive behaviors. With proper treatment, individuals with OCD can learn to manage their symptoms and lead fulfilling lives.`
